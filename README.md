# my-python-programming-journey

Continue improving my Regex Data Validator project
Build automation tools:
-File renamer
-Password generator
-Email/phone/date/digital house address formatter
Create a personal budget tracker program
Explore working with APIs(e.g., currency rates, weather)
Learn basics of Machine Learning and AI in the future
Ultimately, my goal is to become a Data Scientist.
